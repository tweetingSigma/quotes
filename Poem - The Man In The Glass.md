### The Man In The Glass 

_by Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr._ 
 	 
When you get what you want in your struggle for self
  And the world makes you king for a day
Just go to the mirror and look at yourself
  And see what that man has to say.

For it isn’t your father, or mother, or wife 
  Whose judgment upon you must pass
The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
  Is the one staring back from the glass.

He’s the fellow to please – never mind all the rest
  For he’s with you, clear to the end
And you’ve passed your most difficult, dangerous test
  If the man in the glass is your friend.

You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years
  And get pats on the back as you pass
But your final reward will be heartache and tears
  If you’ve cheated the man in the glass.
