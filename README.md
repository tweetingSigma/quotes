I love words. They have the power to change the world. This apple video with Robin Williams speaks it best : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep2_0WHogRQ

This repo is a collection of the words that moved me and changed me. It helps me have it all in one place and also share with others like you. I hope you like them too. :)
