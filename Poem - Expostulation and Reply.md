### Expostulation and Reply

_by William Wordsworth_


>_About the poem :_
>The poem is written with a theme that Nature is a great teacher in itself. In the poem, Wordsworth's friend Matthew questions his logic of daydreaming beside a lake and wasting his time, instead of reading books and gaining knowledge. Wordsworth replies in a mild manner that Nature in itself is a great teacher. That wherever we are, we can learn from nature by seeing, listening, feeling and seeking to learn from it.
>
>This poem was a radical shift from the prevalent thought at that time of learning  from books and one which curtailed creative thinking.

Why, William, on that old grey stone,
Thus for the length of half a day,
Why, William, sit you thus alone,
And dream your time away?

Where are your books?--that light bequeathed
To Beings else forlorn and blind! 
Up! up! and drink the spirit breathed
From dead men to their kind. 

You look round on your Mother Earth,
As if she for no purpose bore you;
As if you were her first-born birth,
And none had lived before you!

One morning thus, by Esthwaite lake,
When life was sweet, I knew not why,
To me my good friend Matthew spake,
And thus I made reply:

The eye--it cannot choose but see;
We cannot bid the ear be still;
Our bodies feel, where'er they be,
Against or with our will.

Nor less I deem that there are Powers
Which of themselves our minds impress;
That we can feed this mind of ours
In a wise passiveness.

Think you, 'mid all this mighty sum
Of things for ever speaking,
That nothing of itself will come,
But we must still be seeking?

--Then ask not wherefore, here, alone,
Conversing as I may,
I sit upon this old grey stone,
And dream my time away.
