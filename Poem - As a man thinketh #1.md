### As a man thinketh # 1

_by James Allen_

```
Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes,
And Man is Mind, and evermore he takes
The tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills,
Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills: â€”
He thinks in secret, and it comes to pass:
Environment is but his looking-glass.
