### As a man thinketh # 2

_by James Allen_

```
So You will be what you will to be;
Let failure find its false content
In that poor word, ’environment,’
But spirit scorns it, and is free.

It masters time, it conquers space;
It cowes that boastful trickster, Chance,
And bids the tyrant Circumstance
Uncrown, and fill a servant’s place.

The human Will, that force unseen,
The offspring of a deathless Soul,
Can hew a way to any goal,
Though walls of granite intervene.

Be not impatient in delays
But wait as one who understands;
When spirit rises and commands
The gods are ready to obey.
