### The law of the Jungle

_by Rudyard Kipling_

```
Now this is the Law of the Jungle -- 
  as old and as true as the sky;
And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, 
  but the Wolf that shall break it must die.

As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk 
  the Law runneth forward and back --
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, 
  and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.

```
